# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to redesign the web app to include all four of Mar's hemisphere images. BeautifulSoup and Splinter was used to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images. MongoDB was used to store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
